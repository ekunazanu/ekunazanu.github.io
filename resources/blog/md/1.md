Imagine you are given a function <span class="mathin">y = f(x)</span>. Now what if I asked you to to represent this function as a sum of sine waves? Seems tricky, if not impossible at first. It might look daunting from afar, but the underlying principle behind Fourier transforms is actually relatively simple and really elegant.

### Use Cases

* Sound Processing
* 

## Euler's Formula

### The complex plane



for any number, <span class="mathin">n<sup>i</sup></span> results in a comlex number.

### Euler's Identity
Now, for <span class="mathin">e<sup>iπ</sup> = -1</span>

<math>testing</math>

I won't pretend to know why it's true, but I am pretty sure it has to do something with calculus. I never paid attention in calc classes, although I might come back later to explain why it happens once I myself have a solid understanding of this phenomena. But for now, take it as a given, and assume e^πi = -1.

Since the complex coordinates now have a frequency of 2π, this means we know have a unit circle, which means we can represent the coordinates in polar form: cosQ, isinQ. Where cosQ represents the x coordinates and isinQ represents the y coordinates.



## ALternatives
Why not just use the unit circle and use sin and cos then? We can! We can also use plain vectors to represent the unit circle. We just represent it using.
